== Summary ==

Google Analytics plugin provides page popularity rankings based on Google Analytics reports for your Vosao site. The plugin uses Google Analytics API to fetch page views counts for top site's pages.

== 1. Setup ==

 * Upload and install plugin's WAR-file
 * Go to site configuration and setup Google Analytics ID to enable page tracking
 * Go to plugins configuration, select Google Analytics plugin and fill in plugin's settings: Google Analytics user email & password. The password is stored as plain text, therefore we recommend registering special Google account with read-only access to your analytics just for this purpose.

== 2. How it works ==

Every 3 hours the plugin will retrieve Google Analytics data for your site and store it in database.

In page templates you can access page views data as follows:

  `$plugin.analytics.getPageViews($page.friendlyUrl)`
    - returns the number of page views for last week

  `$plugin.analytics.topPages(10)`
    - returns top 10 pages

  `$plugin.analytics.topPages("/blog/", 10)`
    - returns top 10 pages having url that starts with /blog/ prefix; multiple prefixes could be listed separated by comma ','

== 3. Sample template script ==

{{{
  <h3>Popular blog posts</h3>
  <ul>
  #foreach ($page in $plugin.analytics.topPages("/blog/", 10))
     <li><a href="$page.friendlyURL">$page.title</a></li>
  #end
  </ul>
}}}
